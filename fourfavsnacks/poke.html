            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Poke was supposedly first prepared by native Polynesians centuries before Westerners arrived on the islands. Poke was made from fresh reef fish seasoned with sea salt, seaweed, and kukui nuts. When Chinese and Japanese immigrants arrived to Hawai’i they introduced soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice elevated the dish even more. The name “poke” was given around the 60’s and 70’s when ahi (tuna) was more available to people and more aesthetically pleasing than the dull gray color of reef fish. 
        </p>
        <p>No one is really credited with inventing the poke bowl but it is a dish that is heavily a part of Hawai’i culinary melting pot. Poke counter shops are everywhere in Hawai’i with multiple varieties. You can swap any type of marinated fresh fish, rice, and toppings making a fit for anyone who actually enjoys eating raw fish.</p>
